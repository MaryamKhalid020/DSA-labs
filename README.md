Table of Contents

Examples

Example 1.1: Function Overloading with References and Pointers

Example 1.2: Complex Number Class

Example 1.3: Template Function for Maximum Value

Example 1.4: Template Class for Pairs

Example 1.5: Template Class with Fixed Size Array

Example 1.6: File Handling - Copying Text with Character Count

Example 1.7: File Handling - Reading and Writing Student Data

Exercises

Exercise 1.1: Extending the Complex Number Class (Multiplication Operator)

Exercise 1.2: Template Class for Minimum Value in Pairs

Exercise 1.3: Template Class for Finding Min/Max Values in an Array

Exercise 1.4: File Handling - Counting Words and Sentences

Exercise 1.5: House Listing Program

Exercise 1.6: Student Grades Processing from File

Prerequisites

To run these C++ programs, you need:

A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, CLion, etc.)

How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-examples.git

Navigate to the repository folder:

cd cpp-examples

Compile any example or exercise using a C++ compiler:

g++ example1_1.cpp -o example1_1
./example1_1

Replace example1_1.cpp with the filename of the example you want to run.

File Descriptions

example1_1.cpp: Demonstrates function overloading using value, reference, and pointer parameters.

example1_2.cpp: Implements a Complex number class with constructors, operator overloading, and a magnitude function.

example1_3.cpp: Uses template functions to find the maximum value between two inputs.

example1_4.cpp: Implements a template class for handling pairs of values.

example1_5.cpp: Demonstrates a template class with an array and methods to find min/max values.

example1_6.cpp: Reads from an input file and writes the content to an output file with character count.

example1_7.cpp: Reads student data from a file, calculates averages, and writes results to an output file.
